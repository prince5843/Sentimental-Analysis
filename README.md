This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using the Sentiment140 dataset. The workflow begins by importing necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn, and downloading the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, which comprises 1.6 million tweets labeled for sentiment, is preprocessed to prepare it for model training. This preprocessing involves several steps: removing non-alphabet characters, converting text to lowercase, splitting the text into individual words, and stemming the words to obtain their root forms while filtering out common stopwords using NLTK's stopwords list. The preprocessed tweets are then vectorized using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert text data into numerical form suitable for machine learning models. The data is split into training and testing sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of sentiment classes. A Logistic Regression model is then trained on the vectorized training data with an iteration limit set to 1000. The trained model achieves high accuracy in predicting sentiments on both the training and testing datasets. The model is saved using pickle, allowing it to be loaded and used for real-time sentiment analysis of new tweets. The predictive capability of the model is demonstrated by making predictions on sample tweets from the test set and classifying them as either positive or negative sentiment. This project showcases the effective application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis, providing a robust tool for analyzing public sentiment on social media platforms.
